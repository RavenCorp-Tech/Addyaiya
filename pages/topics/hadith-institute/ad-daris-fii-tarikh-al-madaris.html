          <p>
            <span class="dropcap">T</span>he book <u><em>ad-Dāris fī Tārīkh al-Madāris</em></u> is considered one of the most important references on the history of ḥadīth schools and the schools of Qurʾān and fiqh. This celebrated work is commonly attributed to an-Nuʿaymī, yet upon careful review I found this attribution to be a mistake&mdash;and I have not encountered anyone who highlighted this point before.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is stated in the introduction of <em>ad-Dāris</em> (1/3) that the author had begun compiling the schools that held influence. He then mentions that his shaykh, Muḥī ad-Dīn an-Nuʿaymī, had preceded him in assembling that very material. The student requested that his teacher pen the work, but an-Nuʿaymī excused himself. Instead, he instructed the student to proceed, providing him with his own notes. The student began composing the book, incorporating what an-Nuʿaymī had given him, and entitled it: <em>Tanbīh aṭ-Ṭālib wa-Irshād ad-Dāris li-Aḥwāl Mawāḍiʿ al-Fāʾidah bi-Dimashq kadūr al-Qurʾān wa-al-Ḥadīth wa-al-Madāris</em>. Thus, the original content belongs to an-Nuʿaymī, but it was refined and edited by this devoted student. None of the modern editors of the book identified who this student was.
          </p>

          <p>
            Later, I found that Shaykh ʿAbdul-Bāsiṭ al-ʿIlmawī (907&ndash;981 AH) had abridged <em>Kitāb at-Tanbīh</em>, and he opened his introduction (p. 1) with the following clarification:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “...After that, this is a concise commentary in which I abridged <em>Kitāb Tanbīh aṭ-Ṭālib wa-Irshād ad-Dāris</em>, which is attributed to the great scholar Muḥī ad-Dīn Abū al-Mafākhir an-Nuʿaymī ash-Shāfiʿī...”
            <cite>&mdash; Shaykh ʿAbdul-Bāsiṭ al-ʿIlmawī</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This abridgment was edited by Ṣalāḥ al-Munajjid, yet he did not pay attention to this matter of attribution. Accordingly, Shaykh al-ʿIlmawī also doubted attributing the book exclusively to an-Nuʿaymī. The reality, as I have explained, is that the original content belongs to an-Nuʿaymī, while his student added material, benefitted from what his shaykh possessed, and refined and edited it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I attempted to uncover the identity of this student. The most likely candidate is the scholar Ibn Ṭūlūn. He was the close disciple of his shaykh an-Nuʿaymī, contributed notably to historical writing, and was well-known during that era.
          </p>

          <p>
            He mentioned in <em>al-Qalāʾid al-Jawhariyyah</em> (1/136):
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “And our shaykh al-Muḥyāwī an-Nuʿaymī said: ‘Our shaykh al-Burhān said...’”
            <cite>&mdash; Ibn Ṭūlūn, <em>al-Qalāʾid al-Jawhariyyah</em> 1/136</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This very text appears verbatim in <em>ad-Dāris</em> (2/75), further reinforcing the connection and pointing to Ibn Ṭūlūn’s hand in shaping the work we read today.
