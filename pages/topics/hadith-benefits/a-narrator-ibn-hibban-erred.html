            <span class="dropcap">A</span>mong Ibn Ḥibbān’s listings is a narrator he placed both among the Tābiʿīn and among their Followers, a duplication that demands clarification.
          </p>

          <p>Ibn Ḥibbān said in the section of the Tābiʿīn in <em>al-Thiqāt</em> (5/550):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Yūsuf ibn ʿAbdillāh ibn al-Ḥārith, the nephew of Ibn Sīrīn, a Baṣrī. He narrates from Anas ibn Mālik. ʿĀṣim al-Aḥwal and Khālid al-Ḥadhdhāʾ narrated from him.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Then he mentioned him in the section of the Followers of the Tābiʿīn (7/633), saying:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Yūsuf ibn ʿAbdillāh ibn al-Ḥārith, the nephew of Ibn Sīrīn, a Baṣrī. He narrates from his father and from Abū al-ʿĀliyah. ʿĀṣim al-Aḥwal, Khālid al-Ḥadhdhāʾ, and the people of Baṣrah narrated from him. It has been said that he saw Anas ibn Mālik.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>I say: They are one and the same, and the correct view is that he is a Tābiʿī, and he heard from Anas ibn Mālik.</p>

          <p>Al-Bukhārī said in <em>al-Tārīkh al-Kabīr</em> (8/372):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Yūsuf ibn ʿAbdillāh ibn al-Ḥārith, the nephew of Muḥammad ibn Sīrīn al-Baṣrī. He heard from his father and from Anas ibn Mālik. ʿĀṣim al-Aḥwal, Khālid al-Ḥadhdhāʾ, Sulaymān ibn al-Mughīrah, and Mubārak ibn Faḍālah narrated from him.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Muslim narrated from him in his <em>Ṣaḥīḥ</em> (4/1725), no. 2196:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Yaḥyā ibn Yaḥyā said: “Abū Khaythamah informed us, from ʿĀṣim al-Aḥwal, from Yūsuf ibn ʿAbdillāh, from Anas ibn Mālik regarding ruqyah. He said: ‘Permission was given for (ruqyah) in cases of poison stings, skin eruptions (namlah), and the evil eye.’”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>He (Muslim) also said:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Abū Bakr ibn Abī Shaybah narrated to us, saying: Yaḥyā ibn Ādam narrated to us, from Sufyān [ḥ]. And Zuhayr ibn Ḥarb narrated to me, saying: Ḥumayd ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān narrated to us, saying: Ḥasan – meaning Ibn Ṣāliḥ – narrated to us, both of them from ʿĀṣim, from Yūsuf ibn ʿAbdillāh, from Anas, who said: ‘The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ permitted ruqyah for the evil eye, poison stings, and skin eruptions (namlah).’”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>And in the narration of Sufyān it is: “Yūsuf ibn ʿAbdillāh ibn al-Ḥārith.”</p>
