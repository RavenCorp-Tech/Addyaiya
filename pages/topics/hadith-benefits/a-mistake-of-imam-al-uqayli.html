          </p>

          <p>Al-Ḥāfiẓ al-ʿUqaylī wrote in <em>al-Ḍuʿafāʾ</em> (3/3):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Suddī from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind — unknown, not followed up in his ḥadīth, and not known from any authentic route. Muḥammad ibn Ayyūb ibn Yaḥyá ibn al-Ḍurays narrated to us, he said: Jundal ibn Wāliq al-Taghlibī narrated to us, he said: Abū Mālik al-Wāsiṭī narrated to us, from ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Suddī, from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind, from Abū Naḍrah, from Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī, from the Prophet ﷺ, who said: ‘Allāh says: Seek the surplus [grace] from the merciful among My servants — you will live under their care, for I have placed My mercy among them. Do not seek it from those whose hearts are hard, for I have placed My wrath among them.’ He is not followed upon this by any sound authority.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Ibn al-Jawzī followed him in <em>al-Mawḍūʿāt</em> (2/158), citing it from al-ʿUqaylī.</p>

          <p>
            Al-Dhahabī also followed this, saying in <em>al-Mughnī fī al-Ḍuʿafāʾ</em> (2/390): “ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Suddī from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind — unknown, his report is false. Al-ʿUqaylī mentioned him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And in <em>al-Mīzān</em> (4/331): “ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Suddī from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind — unknown, and he brought a false report.”
          </p>

          <p>Ibn Ḥajar said in <em>Lisān al-Mīzān</em> (3/446):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Al-Ṭabarānī narrated it in <em>al-Awsaṭ</em> through Muḥammad ibn Marwān al-Suddī from Dāwūd. Likewise, Ibn Ḥibbān in <em>al-Ḍuʿafāʾ</em> (2/286) and al-Kharāʾiṭī in <em>Makārim al-Akhlāq</em> from this route. I suspect that Muḥammad ibn Marwān was kunya’d Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, and it occurred in al-ʿUqaylī’s narration as ‘Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Suddī,’ then the ‘Abū’ dropped, leaving just ʿAbd al-Raḥmān. Thus, this biographical entry does not exist. Moreover, Muḥammad ibn Marwān was not alone; ʿAbd al-Malik ibn al-Khiṭṭāb and ʿAbd al-Ghaffār [1] ibn al-Ḥasan ibn Dīnār also followed him. And it has a witness from ʿAlī’s narration in the <em>Mustadrak</em> of al-Ḥākim. As for al-Ḥusaynī, I read in his own hand that al-Dhahabī erred in isolating it, and that it is actually ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī Karīmah, the father of Ismāʿīl al-Suddī the well-known tābiʿī. But al-Ḥusaynī was incorrect; for Ismāʿīl is older than Dāwūd, let alone his father.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>I say: What Ibn Ḥajar suspected is in fact certain. For Abū al-Shaykh narrated it in <em>Ṭabaqāt al-Muḥaddithīn bi-Iṣfahān</em> (3/285), and Abū Nuʿaym in <em>Tārīkh Iṣfahān</em> (2/318), from the route of Hammām ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Nuʿmān, who said: Jundal ibn Wāliq narrated to us, who said: Abū Mālik al-Wāsiṭī narrated to us, from Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Suddī, from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind, with it.</p>

          <p>
            Al-Ṭabarānī also narrated it in <em>al-Muʿjam al-Awsaṭ</em> (5/76), saying:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muʿāwiyah al-ʿUtubī narrated to us, who said: Mūsá ibn Muḥammad al-Balqāwī narrated to us, who said: Muḥammad ibn Marwān al-Suddī narrated to us, from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind, from Abū Naḍrah, from Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī, who said: The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: ‘Seek grace from the merciful among my Ummah — you will live under their care. Do not seek it from those whose hearts are hard, for they await My wrath.’
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Al-Ṭabarānī said: “None narrated this ḥadīth from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind except Muḥammad ibn Marwān. Mūsá ibn Muḥammad alone transmitted it.”</p>

          <p>
            Al-Quḍāʿī narrated it in <em>Musnad al-Shihāb</em> (1/406) through al-Kharāʾiṭī, from ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muʿāwiyah al-ʿUtubī, from Mūsá ibn Muḥammad, from Muḥammad ibn Marwān and ʿAbd al-Malik ibn al-Khiṭṭāb, who both said: Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind narrated to us, then he mentioned it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then he also narrated it from ʿAbd al-Ghaffār ibn al-Ḥasan ibn Dīnār, from Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind, with it. Then he said: “ʿAbd al-Ghaffār ibn al-Ḥasan ibn Dīnār was alone in narrating it! It is strange.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Tamām al-Rāzī narrated it in <em>al-Fawāʾid</em> (2/74):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Abū ʿAlī Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Faḍālah narrated to us, who said: al-Rabīʿ ibn Sulaymān al-Murādī narrated to us, who said: Abū Khāzim ʿAbd al-Ghaffār ibn al-Ḥasan ibn Dīnār narrated to us, who said: Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind narrated to me, the same.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Tamām said: “Thus it was in Ibn Faḍālah’s book. Others narrated it with an extra man inserted between Abū Khāzim and Dāwūd.”</p>

          <p>
            I say: This ḥadīth is false. These follow-ups do not benefit it, for they are chained together by weak and accused narrators. Muḥammad ibn Mūsá al-Balqāwī is a liar — he is the one narrating from ʿAbd al-Malik ibn al-Khiṭṭāb. As for ʿAbd al-Malik, his state is obscure, but the blame is not on him — rather on his transmitter, this al-Balqāwī. Likewise, Muḥammad ibn Marwān al-Suddī is abandoned, and his transmitter Abū Mālik al-Wāsiṭī is also abandoned (<em>al-Ḍuʿafāʾ waʾl-Matrūkīn</em> of Ibn al-Jawzī, 3/238). As for ʿAbd al-Ghaffār ibn al-Ḥasan ibn Dīnār, Abū Ḥātim al-Rāzī (in <em>al-Jarḥ waʾl-Taʿdīl</em> 6/54) and Ibn Ḥibbān (in <em>al-Thiqāt</em> 8/421) were lenient with him. But the majority declared him weak, even accusing him. Al-Saʿdī said: “His ḥadīth is not considered.” Ibn ʿAdī said: “His aḥādīth are unpreserved” (<em>al-Kāmil</em> 5/328). Al-Azdī said: “A liar” (<em>al-Ḍuʿafāʾ waʾl-Matrūkīn</em> of Ibn al-Jawzī 2/112). The correct view is that he was weak, seemingly hearing from weak and lying narrators then dropping them in his transmission. And Allāh knows best.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for the witness Ibn Ḥajar referred to: al-Ḥākim narrated it in <em>al-Mustadrak</em> (4/357) through Ḥibbān ibn ʿAlī, from Saʿd ibn Ṭarīf, from al-Aṣbagh ibn Nubātah, from ʿAlī (raḍiy Allāhu ʿanhu), who said: The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “O ʿAlī, seek good from the merciful among my Ummah — you will live under their care. Do not seek it from those whose hearts are hard, for the curse descends upon them. O ʿAlī, verily Allāh created goodness and created for it people. He made it beloved to them, and made its practice beloved to them, and directed seekers towards them — just as water flows in fertile land, bringing it to life along with its people. O ʿAlī, the people of goodness in this world are the people of goodness in the Hereafter.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Al-Ḥākim said: “This ḥadīth has a ṣaḥīḥ isnād, though they (al-Bukhārī and Muslim) did not narrate it.”</p>
          <p>Al-Dhahabī refuted him: “Al-Aṣbagh is weak, and Ḥibbān was also deemed weak.”</p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
          <p>
            [1] In the original it appeared as “ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz,” and likewise in Abū Ghuddah’s edition of <em>Lisān</em> (5/153), but this is a mistake. The correct name is ʿAbd al-Ghaffār ibn al-Ḥasan ibn Dīnār, Abū Khāzim — with khāʾ, as Ibn Mākūlā recorded.
