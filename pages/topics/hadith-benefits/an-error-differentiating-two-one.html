            <span class="dropcap">A</span>ssessing Ibn Ḥibbān’s treatment of Muḥammad ibn Khālid ibn ʿAthmah shows how a single narrator was split into two separate entries.
          </p>

          <p>Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned in the section of the Followers of the Tābiʿīn in <em>al-Thiqāt</em> (9/55):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Muḥammad ibn Khālid ibn ʿAthmah: from the people of Baṣrah, narrates from Mālik and others. Bundār and the people of Baṣrah narrated from him. He sometimes brings rare reports.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Then he repeated him after several entries (9/67), saying:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Muḥammad ibn Khālid ibn ʿAthmah, the freedman of Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān al-Hāshimī, and ʿAthmah is his mother. He narrates from Mālik ibn Anas and Mūsā ibn Yaʿqūb al-Zumaʿī. Abū Mūsā Muḥammad ibn al-Muthannā and the people of ʿIrāq narrated from him. He sometimes erred.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>I say: Thus Ibn Ḥibbān separated them, but they are one. Neither al-Mizzī nor Ibn Ḥajar noticed this, for both of them cited Ibn Ḥibbān’s statement regarding the second.</p>

          <p>Al-Mizzī said in <em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl</em> (25/143) in his biography:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“And Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned him in al-Thiqāt and said: ‘He sometimes erred.’”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>But al-Bukhārī and others combined them:</p>

          <p>Al-Bukhārī said in <em>al-Tārīkh al-Kabīr</em> (1/73):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Muḥammad ibn Khālid, also said: Ibn ʿAthmah, and ʿAthmah is his mother, a Baṣrī, the freedman of Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān. He heard from Kathīr ibn ʿAbdillāh, and from Mūsā al-Zumaʿī. Muḥammad ibn al-Muthannā narrated from him.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>And Ibn Abī Ḥātim said in <em>al-Jarḥ waʾl-Taʿdīl</em> (7/243):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Muḥammad ibn Khālid ibn ʿAthmah, and ʿAthmah is his mother. He narrated from: Mūsā ibn Yaʿqūb al-Zumaʿī, ʿAbdullāh ibn Jaʿfar al-Makhzūmī, Saʿīd ibn Bashīr, Mālik ibn Anas, Kathīr ibn ʿAbdillāh al-Muzanī, and Muḥammad ibn Hilāl. Narrated from him: ʿAlī ibn al-Madīnī, Muḥammad ibn al-Muthannā, Muḥammad ibn Bashshār, ʿAmr ibn ʿAlī, and Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-ʿAnbarī. I heard my father say that.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            ʿAbdullāh ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal said: I asked my father about Muḥammad ibn Khālid ibn ʿAthmah, and he said: “I see nothing wrong with his ḥadīth.” I asked my father about Muḥammad ibn Khālid, and he said: “Ṣāliḥ al-ḥadīth (acceptable in ḥadīth).”
          </p>

          <p>
            ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī Ḥātim said: Abū Zurʿah was asked about Muḥammad ibn Khālid ibn ʿAthmah, and he said: “A Baṣrī, no harm in him.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Ibn Ḥibbān mentioned in the first that Bundār narrated from him, and in the second that he narrated from Mūsā al-Zumaʿī. And here is a ḥadīth that combines both, narrated by al-Tirmidhī in his <em>Jāmiʿ</em> (2/354):
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Muḥammad ibn Bashshār (Bundār) said: Ḥaddathanā Muḥammad ibn Khālid ibn ʿAthmah, qāl: ḥaddathanī Mūsā ibn Yaʿqūb al-Zumaʿī, qāl: ḥaddathanī ʿAbdullāh ibn Kaysān: that ʿAbdullāh ibn Shaddād informed him, from ʿAbdullāh ibn Masʿūd, that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said:
              “The people closest to me on the Day of Judgment are those who send the most ṣalāh (blessings) upon me.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Al-Tirmidhī said:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “This is a ḥadīth ḥasan gharīb. And it has been narrated from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: ‘Whoever sends one ṣalāh upon me, Allāh will send ten upon him and write for him ten good deeds.’”
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            I say: This is a ḥadīth uniquely narrated by Mūsā ibn Yaʿqūb al-Zumaʿī, and he was inconsistent in it, and he is weak—his ḥadīth are not used as proof. I have detailed the discussion on this ḥadīth elsewhere, and to Allāh belongs all praise.
