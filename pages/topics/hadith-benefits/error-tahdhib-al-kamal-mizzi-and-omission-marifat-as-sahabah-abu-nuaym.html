            <span class="dropcap">A</span>l-Mizzī mentioned in the biography of Ḥarīz ibn ʿUthmān al-Ḥimṣī (5/570–571), among those who narrated from him:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“… and Abū Hammām Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd al-Zubaydī al-Ḥimṣī, one of the unknowns…”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This is a mistake! Abū Hammām is not the <em>kunya</em> of this Saʿīd. Rather, the one who narrates from Saʿīd is Abū Hammām al-Sukūnī al-Walīd ibn Shujāʿ.
          </p>

          <p>
            It seems that in the chain relied upon by al-Mizzī—or by the author of the source (<em>Ṣāḥib al-Kamāl</em>)—the word “ʿan” (from) was dropped, so it became: “Abū Hammām Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd.”
            The correct version is: “Abū Hammām, <em>from</em> Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Ibn ʿAdī narrated in the biography of Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd in <em>al-Kāmil</em> (4/464):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>“Ibn Nājah reported to us, he said: Abū Hammām reported to us, he said: Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd al-Zubaydī reported to us, he said: Ḥarīz ibn ʿUthmān reported to me, he said: ʿAmr ibn Qays al-Kindī reported to me, from Jarīr ibn Shuraḥbīl al-Kindī, who said: I heard al-Miqdām ibn Maʿdīkarib al-Kindī, the companion of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, say: ‘When you come out with your funerals, then form three rows and strive in supplication for your deceased, for I hope that he will be forgiven and that you will be granted intercession for him.’”</em></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This is the ḥadīth which Abū Hammām narrates from Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd, from Ḥarīz.
          </p>

          <p>
            And there are other aḥādīth in which Abū Hammām al-Sukūnī narrates from Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd al-Zubaydī, such as what is found with Ibn ʿAsākir in his <em>Tārīkh</em> (1/395), and with al-Khallāl in <em>al-Amr bil-Maʿrūf waʾn-Nahy ʿan al-Munkar</em> (p. 39).

          <h3>An Omission in the Printed Edition of Maʿrifat al-Ṣaḥābah by Abū Nuʿaym!</h3>

          <p>
            In the printed edition of Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī’s <em>Maʿrifat al-Ṣaḥābah</em> (1/340) (1061), it is found:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥamdān Abū ʿAmr al-Naysābūrī narrated to us, he said: al-Ḥasan ibn Sufyān narrated to us [ḥ].<br />
            And Muḥammad ibn Ḥumayd narrated to us, he said: Ḥāmid ibn Shuʿayb narrated to us, they both said: Abū Hammām Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd al-Zubaydī narrated to us, he said: Ḥuyayy ibn ʿAbdullāh al-Waṣābī narrated to me, he said: Abū ʿAbdullāh al-Dimashqī narrated to me, he said: I heard Aktham ibn al-Jawn al-Khuzāʿī al-Kaʿbī say: The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said: ‘O Aktham ibn al-Jawn, go out with your people to battle; your character will improve, and you will be honored among your companions.’ And Ḥāmid said in his narration: Ḥuyayy ibn Mikhamar.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <strong>I say:</strong> Here also the word “ʿan” fell out of the isnād, so it became: “Abū Hammām Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd.” This is an error. The correct version is: “Abū Hammām, from Saʿīd ibn Abī Saʿīd al-Zubaydī …”
          </p>

          <p>
            The ḥadīth was narrated by Ibn Qāniʿ in <em>Muʿjam al-Ṣaḥābah</em> (1/61):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdūs ibn Kāmil narrated to us, he said: al-Walīd ibn Shujāʿ narrated to us, he said: Saʿīd al-Zubaydī narrated to me, he said: Ḥuyayy ibn ʿAmr al-Waṣṣābī narrated to me, from Abū ʿAbdullāh al-Shāmī, with it.”</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            And Ibn ʿAsākir narrated it in his <em>Tārīkh</em> (67/37) through the route of Abū Yaʿlā al-Mawṣilī:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>“Abū Hammām al-Walīd ibn Shujāʿ narrated to us, he said: Saʿīd al-Zubaydī—who is Ibn ʿAbd al-Jabbār—narrated to me, he said: Ḥuyayy ibn Mikhamar al-Waṣṣābī narrated to me, with it.”</p>
          </blockquote>
