            <span class="dropcap">I</span>t appears in the verification of <em>al-Maṭālib al-ʿĀliyah</em> (13/15), the volume verified by Qāsim ibn Ṣāliḥ al-Qāsim under the supervision of Dr. Saʿd ibn Nāṣir al-Shathrī, published by Dār al-ʿĀṣimah for Publishing and Distribution in partnership with Dār al-Ghayth, first edition:
          </p>

          <p>
            The verifier said:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “Ahmad narrated in <em>al-Zuhd</em> (p. 204): He said: Ḥaddathanā Hāshim, ḥaddathanā Jarīr, from ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī ʿAwf who said: Abū al-Dardāʾ said: ‘Doubt is from disbelief, wailing is from the practices of Jāhiliyyah, poetry is the flutes of Iblīs, ghulūl (stealing from war booty) is embers from Hellfire, wine is the sum of all sins, youth is a branch of madness, women are the snares of Satan, arrogance is worse than evil, the worst of food is the wealth of the orphan, the worst of earnings is usury, the fortunate one is he who takes admonition from others, and the wretched one is he who is wretched in his mother’s womb.’

            He said: ‘Its isnād’s narrators are trustworthy, except for Jarīr — he is Ibn ʿUthmān al-Raḥabī. I did not find a biography for him.’ End quote.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            I say: Thus he mentioned the name as “Jarīr” with a jīm! What is strange is that he claimed he did not find a biography for him, while at the same time identifying him and saying: “He is Ibn ʿUthmān al-Raḥabī.” How then did he know his lineage but could not find a biography for him!
          </p>

          <p>
            The correct version is that it is Ḥarīz (with ḥāʾ) ibn ʿUthmān al-Raḥabī al-Ḥimṣī, the well-known reliable transmitter, who was narrated from by the compilers except Muslim. His biography is found in all the books, including <em>Tahdhīb al-Kamāl</em> (1175).
