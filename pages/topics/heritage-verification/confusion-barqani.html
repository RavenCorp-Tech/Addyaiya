            <span class="dropcap">I</span>t appears in <em>Suʾālāt al-Barqānī</em> (p. 69), verified by Dr. ʿAbd al-Raḥīm al-Qashqarī:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Al-Barqānī said: I heard Abū al-Ḥasan say:</p>
            <p>(528) Yaḥyā al-Jābir: He is Ibn ʿAbdullāh al-Taymī, a Kufan, to be considered.</p>
            <p>(529) Muḥabbar: He is not followed in his ḥadīths, and he hardly narrates from his shuyūkh except through him.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            I say: This is how the doctor recorded these two entries, and this is a mistake. They are in fact one biography, and Muḥabbar has nothing to do with this. Al-Barqānī here was listing under the section of names beginning with yāʾ. If it were correct, he would have mentioned Muḥabbar under the section of names beginning with mīm.
          </p>

          <p>
            The correct version is that this is one entry for Yaḥyā al-Jābir, and the correct statement of al-Dāraqutnī is:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “Yaḥyā al-Jābir is Ibn ʿAbdullāh al-Taymī, a Kufan, to be considered. <em>Mujabbir</em>, not followed in his ḥadīths, and he hardly narrates from his shuyūkh except through him.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            So the doctor misread the word <em>mujabbir</em> (bone-setter) as <em>muḥabbar</em> (with ḥāʾ), and thought it was a separate entry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ibn Ḥajar also transmitted al-Dāraqutnī’s wording — without mentioning <em>mujabbir</em> — in <em>Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb</em> (11/209) in the biography of “Yaḥyā ibn ʿAbdullāh al-Jābir.” He said:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “And al-Dāraqutnī said: A Kufan, to be considered; not followed in his ḥadīths, and he hardly narrates from his shuyūkh except through him.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            He did not include al-Dāraqutnī’s wording <em>mujabbir</em> because he had already mentioned at the beginning of the biography:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “He is also called al-Mujabbir al-Taymī al-Bakrī, their mawlā, Abū al-Ḥārith al-Kūfī, who used to set bones.”
          </blockquote>
